# resume

Available in [JSON](resume.json), [HTML](resume.html), or [PDF](resume.pdf) format.

My [JSON resume](https://github.com/jsonresume) was made using [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli); the HTML and PDF were created from that using [jsonresume-theme-spartan](https://github.com/phoinixi/jsonresume-theme-spartan).
